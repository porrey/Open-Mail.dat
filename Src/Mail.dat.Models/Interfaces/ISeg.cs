		/// fewer the segments within a Mail.dat® the better. It is only appropriate to create a unique segment
		/// when it is needed to separate part of a mailing for different processing. For instance, a portion of
		/// a mailing might need to have an invoice attached in an off-line operation, or the bulk copies of a
		/// Periodical might need to be prepared in cartons. Another example might be different versions of a
		/// catalog, which cannot be produced, in a selective binding process. In such cases, individual
		/// segments could be appropriate. Segmenting should not be used to differentiate among entry points
		/// unless they will need to be processed in some fundamentally different fashion. Similarly,
		/// segmentation should not be used to create reporting categories from information that is otherwise
